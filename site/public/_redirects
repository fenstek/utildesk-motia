# SEO guard: missing tool pages must not rewrite to homepage (200).
# NOTE: Cloudflare Pages does not support 404 status in _redirects.
# The proper fix is to disable "SPA fallback rewrite" in Pages dashboard settings.
# Previously attempted: /tools/*  /404.html  404  (invalid for Pages)

# Duplicate tool redirects (301)
# Specific rules must come BEFORE any wildcard rules
