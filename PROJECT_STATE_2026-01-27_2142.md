# utildesk-motia — State Snapshot (checkpoint)

## Repo / Deploy
- Repo: fenstek/utildesk-motia
- Cloudflare Pages Root Directory: /site
- Content: /content/tools/*.md
- Pages:
  - site/src/pages/index.astro
  - site/src/pages/tools/index.astro
  - site/src/pages/tools/[slug].astro
- Styling: site/public/styles/global.css
- Layout: site/src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro

## Current situation (observed)
- Tools list exists and works.
- Tool detail pages render markdown content.
- Pills/badges and tags are displayed.
- Images: pulled from frontmatter `image` and/or first markdown image (no duplication goal).
- FAQ accordion is not reliable yet for current markdown FAQ formatting (needs solution).

## Primary UX issues (priority)
1) Homepage looks empty — needs content blocks.
2) Cards on /tools are "ok", but not final.
3) Tool detail layout is not satisfying visually.

## Desired homepage MVP (next)
- Homepage should include:
  1) A compact Tools section (cards preview, e.g. 6–12 items)
  2) Tag cloud (all unique tags across tools), with links
- Tags / pills must be clickable links:
  - On homepage tag cloud: click -> /tools/?tag=...
  - On tools cards: tag pills clickable -> /tools/?tag=...
  - On tool detail page: tags clickable -> /tools/?tag=...
  - Category / price_model pills clickable:
    - /tools/?category=...
    - /tools/?price=...

## Rules for next iteration (Claude Code / Codex)
- NO pushes to master.
- Work only in a feature branch + PR.
- No huge regex rewrites of HTML.
- Minimal, reversible changes.
- If result is bad: revert quickly to git tag checkpoint (no manual copy-paste for hours).

## Candidate implementation approach (for later)
- Add filtering on /tools via query params:
  - ?tag=, ?category=, ?price=
- Build tag index by scanning frontmatter in /content/tools/*.md
